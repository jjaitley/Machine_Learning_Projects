In this notebook, we learn how to use scikit-learn to implement Multiple linear regression. We download a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, Evaluate your model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value
